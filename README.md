# UFCFHQ-45-3 Comprehensive Creative- Technology Project Final Subproject
This repository is dedicated to the final subproject for my Comprehensive Creative- Technology Project.

## Introduction
This project originated from a curiosity towards the perspective change and the following change in gameplay that could be implemented through non-Euclidean elements in Euclidean space. The origins of this project came from the initial question of “Could I create large maps in small spaces while catering it to a specific genre, and how would that impact the playability?”

This project aims to explore different geometries within multiple game genres. An example would be to figure out which combination creates the greatest gameplay experience with a compact map design.
